# Fake News Detection

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model classifies news as **Fake** or **Real** based on textual content.

---

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to build an intelligent system that can identify misleading or fake news articles by analyzing their text using machine learning algorithms.

---

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains labeled news articles with the following fields:
- **title** – headline of the news  
- **text** – full news content  
- **label** – Fake or Real  

The dataset is preprocessed before training the model.

---

## Methodology

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Text vectorization using TF-IDF  
3. Model training using machine learning classifiers  
4. Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix  

---

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Naive Bayes  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

---

## Results

The trained model achieves good accuracy in classifying fake and real news articles.  
Among the tested models, **Logistic Regression** performed the best.
